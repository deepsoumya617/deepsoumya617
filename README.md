🇮🇳 from India

🌱 now learning:
  - Backend development [Full Time] (`Node.js`, `TypeScript`, `PostgreSQL`, `Prisma ORM`, `Drizzle ORM`, `Zod`)  
  - DevOps Basics (`Docker`, `CI/CD pipelines`, `Linux`, `Nginx`, `AWS basics`)  
  - Caching & Background Jobs (`Redis`, `BullMQ/queues`, `workers`)  
  - DSA with C++ (sometimes, when i become overconfident++)
  - 日本語 🗾 

💡 I love to build **full-stack saas products** from scratch.  
   On weekends I try experimenting with side  `pro-[duct/ject]s` , but I procrastinate a lot (っ◞‸◟ c). Though you can check my old `pro-[duct/ject]s`.🌼
