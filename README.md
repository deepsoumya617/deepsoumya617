🌱 now learning:
  - Backend development [Full Time] (mostly w `Node.js` and `Expressjs`)  
  - DSA with C++ (sometimes, when i become overconfident++)

💡 I love to build **full-stack saas products** from scratch.  
   On weekends I try experimenting with side  `projects` , but I procrastinate a lot (っ◞‸◟ c). Though you can check my old `projects`.🌼
