hi 👋, i’m **soumyadeep ghosh** (you can call me ***deep***).

i can do anything. i’m a **full-stack engineer**. i love building **ai-powered saas products** ~ mostly for `web` to make the lives of the common people easier. i enjoy creaing *scalable backend systems* using **node.js** + **typescript** + **express.js** and i’m deeply interested in **distributed systems** 
and **DevOps**. besides that, i enjoy creating small animated *ui blocks* using `motion`.

i love to work in the `typescript` ecosystem. i mostly ship products with `nextjs`, `tailwind`, `nodejs`/`bun`, `expressjs`, `drizzle`, `postgresq`, `polar`, `redis`, `docker`, `opanAPI` and `aws`. here are some alternatives i love to use and feel comfortable with - `honojs`, `prisma`, `mongodb`, `supabase` and a lot more...

 these days, i’m actively exploring diff. concepts like `tRPC` and  **generative ai**, working with ideas like `RAG`, `MCP`, and `Vector Databases` etc.
